### To create a django project 
django-admin startproject <nameofapplication>

### how to run a django project 
python manage.py runserver

### DJANGO PROJECT FILES 
1. manage.py :: command line utility allowing us to access 
the django project : entry file 
2. todolist/ : this directory is the actual python django project 
3. __init__.py : this is an empty file that indicates above 
directory is a python project
4. asgi.py :  an entry file for ASGI compatible web servers
to serve your project 
5. wsgi.py :  an entry file for WSGI compatible web servers
to serve your project
6. settings.py : settings/configuration file for the django
project 
7. urls.py : these url declarations that map to our django app. 

### HOW TO CREATE AN APP INSIDE A DJANGO PROJECT
python manage.py startapp <nameoftheapp>

### DJANGO APP FILES 
1. migrations/ : database migration files (empty initially)
2. __init__.py : indicates the app is a python application 
3. admin.py : used to register models for the django admin panel 
4. apps.py : contains the app configurations 
5. models.py : defines the database models (tables)
6. tests.py : contains test cases for the app 
7. views.py : handle request-response logic (functional/controller)
8. urls.py (manually created on app level) : define url patterns 
for the app


### JINJA TEMPLATING 
This is a syntax used to create django interfaces 
- To create templates
  a. Inside the templates you can create .html files , .css , .js 
  b. To consolidate the templating for our project , modify the following 
     - set a global templates directory for referencing our templates i.e. 
       move the  todolist templates folder to the global perspective 
       i.e. root directory level
- register this change in settings.py for the project under the templates directory
  settings 
              'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / 'templates'],  # Add this line



### STEPS TO INCLUDE DB PERSISTENCY FOR PROJECTS IN DJANGO 
models.py : converted to db tables by django 
After defining our models.py 
1/ python manage.py makemigrations appname 
2/ python manage.py migrate 

### STEPS TO ADD A DATA SOURCE 
1. Double click on the db.sqlite3 file 
2. Or simply from pycharm select the database icon 
3. click the + sign or the prompt to create the data source
   (for development use sqlite3)


### RELATION DATABASES : DATABASE RELATIONSHIPS 
1. One to Many Relationship 
    - Taskers table (Contain the users who will perform the tasks)
    - Task table (Contains the tasks)
To establish a one to many relationship establish a ForiengKey
    - a unique key pointing to a unique reference in another db 
   table
2. many to many relationship

### HOW TO ADD IMAGES (STATIC )
1. Django uses static directory 
project-root directory/ => static/ => images/ 
2. Add {% load static %} at the top of the html file 
3. Add this to the settings.py 
STATIC_URL = "/static/"

# Ensure Django knows where to find static files
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
]
remember to import OS ''

### DJANGO ADMIN 
Create a super user for content management purposes 
1. Register your models in admin.py 
2. Creating a super admin user for the project 

python manage.py createsuperuser 
3. Visit the link appurl/admin - use the superuser credentials to login

### DJANGO APIS (APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE)
Is a set of rules that allows different software apps to 
communicate with each other 
#### Think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant 
1. You(Frontend/client) make an order(request)
2. The waiter(API) takes the request to the kitchen(server/backend)
3. The kitchen(server) prepares the food(process the request)
4. The waiter(API) brings back the meal(response) to you 
### TYPES OF APIS 
1. REST API  => Uses HTTP methods ::
- GET :: use this to request data from servers (default)
- POST :: use this to save or send data to servers 
- PUT :: use this to update on data on servers 
- PATCH :: use this to update only a section of your data 
- DELETE :: use this to remove data from your servers 
2. GraphQL API => Allows clients/frontend to access data only when needed
3. SOAP API => Uses XML methods / older (secure)
4. WebSocket API => Enable real time data transfer (chat applications)
### Steps to create an API project in DJANGO 
1. Install djangorestframework :: pip install djangorestframework 
2. Add djangorestframework as part of the installed apps 
3. Have views return data as .json files 
4. Create serializers (picking the data to showcase from the API) 
In the app's api project create a serializers.py file 
### JSON (JavaScript object notation)
This is an interchangeable data format that can be used across any 
application 

 python manage.py startapp todolistappapi
 pip install djangorestframework : python 
 pipx install djangorestframework --include-deps : python3


FrontEnd(HTML <CSS (web) , Android(Jetpack compose) , React Native ,
Reactjs)
=> middleware => backend (server scripting(python->django), database)

### AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION 
- Authentication :: IDENTITY MANAGEMENT :: WHO IS USING THE APP 
- Authorization :: USER PRIVILEDGES :: WHAT USER CAN DO ONCE AUTHENTICATED 

### STEPS IN CREATING AN AUTHENTICATION MODULE 
1. Within settings.py of the project modify the authentication
settings 
a. LOGIN_URL :: ## redirect unauthenticated users back to the login screen 
b. LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL :: ## After login what page will the user see 
c. LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL :: ## After logout , redirect user back to login 
screen
2. Create views function for the register, login and logout processes 
3. Create the rendered/redirected templates 
4. Register the urls to map to the authentication functions in views
5. Do migrations :: python manage.py migrate

### EXTENDING THE DJANGO AUTH USER MODEL 
1. Import the class AbstractUser in our models.py 
2. Create the custom user class , name should be CustomUser
3. Tell django to use the custom model for the user : settings.py
4. Update our forms to also use the custom model 
   a. create a forms.py in the app folder , write out our custom
   user form 
5. Update the views function to use the custom model / form
6. Updating the templates to reflect the new inputs :: register.html
7. Ensure that our django can handle media 
   a. inside settings.py media_url , media_root 
  b. urls.py include the media reference as part of the urlpatterns 
8. pip install pillow :: package to allow file uploads 
8. reset the database and make new migrations  
     - delete the migration.py file in the migrations folder 
     - delete the db.sqlite file
    - python manage.py makemigrations appname 
    - python manage.py migrate 

### To change repo url from clone process 
> git remote set-url origin  <repo url>
> 
> ### lINUX 
> Install Intellij IDEA COMMUNITY FOR KOTLIN
